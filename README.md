üî≠ **Who am I:** With over 15 years of experience spanning software engineering, system architecture, project
management, and leadership, I bring a deep technical and strategic understanding to every project
I work on. My expertise is rooted in Ruby on Rails, Python, Node.js and Java, and I am proficient in
a broad range of both front-end and back-end web frameworks. I‚Äôve thrived in various roles‚Äî
whether as a self-managed team member, collaborating with fellow leaders, or leading teams of up
to 10 developers. Having worked with both local and international teams, I am well-versed in
delivering software solutions on time and within budget, no matter the scope.

üå± **Currently learning:** Exploring advanced Rails patterns and best practices.

üí¨ **Ask me about:** Anything related to full-stack development. I'm always up for a coding discussion!
